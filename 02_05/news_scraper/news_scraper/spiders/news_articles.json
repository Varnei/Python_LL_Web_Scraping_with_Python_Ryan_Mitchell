", "Music studio assistant Yahaya Sharif-Aminu was sentenced to death by hanging on August 10 after being convicted of blasphemy by an Islamic court in northern Nigeria. ", "The judgment document states that Sharif-Aminu, 22, was convicted for making \"a blasphemous statement against Prophet Mohammed in a WhatsApp Group,\" which is contrary to the Kano State Sharia Penal Code and is an offence which carries the death sentence. ", "The recording was shared widely, causing mass outrage in the highly conservative, majority Muslim, state, according to various reports. ", "\"Whoever insults, defames or utters words or acts which are capable of bringing into disrespect ... such a person has committed a serious crime which is punishable by death,\" according to a translation of court documents provided to CNN by his lawyers. ", "Read More", "Sharif-Aminu, described by his friend Kabiru Ibrahim, as \"kind, religious and dutiful,\" admitted charges of blasphemy during his trial, but said he had made a mistake. ", "No legal representation", "Under Sharia law, a voluntary confession is binding, according to court papers. ", "Sharif-Aminu's lawyers, who became involved in the case only after his conviction, say he was not allowed legal representation before or during his trial -- in contravention of Nigerian citizens' constitutional right to legal representation. ", "Outrage as Nigeria sentences 13-year-old boy to 10 years in prison for blasphemy", "According to the lawyers, the Sharia court adjourned his case four times because no lawyer came forth from the Legal Aid Council to represent him, likely because of the sensitivity of the case. The Sharia court is, however, statute-bound to provide legal representation.", "Advocates from the ", "Foundation for Religious Freedom", " (FRF), a not-for-profit aimed at protecting religious freedom in Nigeria, which is representing Sharif-Aminu, told CNN he has also not been permitted access to legal advice to prepare an appeal against his conviction. ", "The FRF says it has lodged an appeal on his behalf in Kano's high court, a common-law court with constitutional powers. ", "\"The state laws he is accused of breaking are in gross conflict with the Nigerian constitution,\" said his counsel, Kola Alapinni. ", "No Muslim will condone it. People hold Prophet Mohammed higher than their parents. ", "Islamic cleric, Bashir Aliyu Umar", "Kano's State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje told clerics in Kano that he would sign Sharif-Aminu's death warrant as soon as the singer had exhausted the appeals process, local media reports say. ", "\"I assure you that immediately the Supreme Court affirms the judgment, I will sign it without any hesitation,\" Ganduje said, according to ", "Nigeria's Daily Post newspaper", ". CNN contacted a spokesman for Governor Ganduje several times for comment but did not receive a response. ", "Islamic scholar and cleric Bashir Aliyu Umar, who is not connected to the case, but said he had read the transcript of the court proceedings, told CNN, \"No Muslim will condone it. People hold Prophet Mohammed higher than their parents, and when things like this happen, it will lead to a breakdown of peace because of mob action and attacks against the accused.\" ", "When news of Sharif-Aminu's alleged crime broke earlier this year, protesters marched to his family home and destroyed it, prompting his father to flee to a neighboring town, his lawyers told CNN. Sharif-Aminu went into hiding, according to Amnesty and his lawyers, but in March he was arrested by the Hisbah Corps, the religious police force that enforces Sharia law in Kano state. ", "'A travesty of justice'", "Human rights organization Amnesty International has described Sharif-Aminu's trial as a \"travesty of justice,\" and called on Kano state authorities to quash his conviction and death sentence. ", "\"There are serious concerns about the fairness of his trial and the framing of the charges against him based on his Whatsapp messages,\" said Amnesty's Nigeria director Osai Ojigho. \"Furthermore, the imposition of the death penalty following an unfair trial violates the right to life,\" she added. ", "The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) has also condemned Sharif-Aminu's death sentence. It said Nigeria's blasphemy laws were inconsistent with universal human rights standards. ", "\"It is unconscionable that Sharif-Aminu is facing a death sentence merely for expressing his beliefs artistically through music,\" said the organization's commissioner, Frederick A. Davie, in a statement. ", "The organization released a ", "follow-up statement", " saying it had adopted Aminu-Sharif as \"a religious prisoner of conscience.\"  ", "Atheism frowned upon ", "Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation and religion permeates every facet of life here, with prayers routinely said in schools and public offices. In addition to blasphemy, atheism is frowned upon by many in the majority Muslim north as well as in parts of the mostly Christian south. ", "Human rights groups have expressed concern over a crackdown on freedom of speech and expression, particularly when it comes to religion.

But Premier Giuseppe Conte warned that a steady, nine-week rise in infections nationwide demanded new preventive measures to stave off economically-devastating closures and shutdowns.", "\u201cWe have to be more rigorous because we want to avoid at all cost more restrictive measures for production and social activities,\u201d Conte said.", "The decree was passed on the same day that Italy added 3,678 new infections and 31 deaths to its official coronavirus toll, the highest increase in new cases since the peak of the outbreak in April. Both hard-hit Lombardy and southern Campania added more than 500 cases each. ", "Italy has over 36,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths, the second-highest number in Europe after Britain.", "Even though the World Health Organization doesn\u2019t specifically recommend masks outdoors for the general population, the trend has taken off in Italy, particularly as new clusters have been identified in southern regions that largely escaped the first wave of infection.", "The new mask mandate was contained in a government decree extending the state of emergency until Jan. 31. It requires residents to have masks on them at all times outdoors, and wear them unless they can guarantee that they can remain completely isolated from anyone other than family. That effectively makes them obligatory outdoors in all urban and semi-urban settings, with exemptions for eating in restaurants and bars.", "In addition, masks must now be worn indoors everywhere except private homes, but even at home, Conte urged Italians to keep their distances with relatives, given most new infections are occurring within families. ", "\u201cThe state can\u2019t ask citizens to wear masks in their own homes,\u201d Conte said. \u201cBut we have a strong recommendation for all citizens: Even in our families we have to be careful.\u201d", "Exceptions include for outdoor sporting activities, children under 6 and for people with health conditions that preclude wearing masks. ", "Fines ranging from 400 to 1,000 euros ($463 to $1,163) are foreseen for violations, Italian news agency ANSA said. ", "Italy thus is joining Spain, Turkey, North Macedonia, India and a handful of other Asian countries in imposing a nationwide, outdoor mask mandate. Spain has had such a requirement in place since mid-May and Turkey since last month. ", "Elsewhere in Europe, such outdoor mandates are in effect in hot spot cities such as Paris, Brussels and Pristina, Kosovo. In many Asian countries, social pressure to wear masks outdoors has made binding government decrees unnecessary. The Australian state of Victoria has had one in place for weeks.", "Italy has one of the lowest infection rates in Europe, at 46.5 cases per 100,000 residents over the last two weeks. By contrast, the Czech Republic counts 327 per 100,000 while Spain has 302, France 248 and Belgium 233 per 100,000.", "While Paris and Brussels have closured bars to cope with the rising infections and Britain has capped pub hours, Conte has said that Italy wouldn\u2019t impose any curfews or close bars. ", "The Vatican, which followed Italy\u2019s strict lockdown in spring and summer, also imposed an outdoor mask mandate this week in the tiny city state in the center of Rome. Pope Francis, however, didn\u2019t wear a mask during his indoor general audience Wednesday, even as he greeted well-wishers and shook their hands.", "Italy became the epicenter of the European outbreak after the first domestic case was identified Feb. 21 in northern Lombardy. The country largely tamed the virus with a strict, nationwide 10-week lockdown, but infections have crept up since August vacations.", "There have been various hypotheses for why Italy\u2019s rebound has been slower than in neighboring countries like Spain or France, where daily new cases often top 10,000. Chief among them is the fact that Italians, seriously scared by the devastation of the initial outbreak in the north, have generally abided by mask mandates and social distancing norms. ", "Also, Italy\u2019s national health care system has continued to aggressively trace new infection, as well as test passengers on arrival from at-risk countries \u2014 and even from its own island of Sardinia after the jet-set destination became a hotspot this summer.", "That said, Italy\u2019s testing capacity has its limitations. It can only process around 120,000 tests a day, more than double what it processed during the peak of the outbreak. But some experts say Italy needs to more than double that number as the virus has now spread across the country.", "__", "Follow AP\u2019s pandemic coverage at ", " and "]},

Glenn Wakai, chair of the Committee on Economic Development, Tourism and Technology, said one problem is that the tests are not mandatory for all.

Some have flouted safety measures, leading to arrests and fines for the scofflaws. ", "Before the pandemic, the state received about 30,000 visitors a day. ", "If the islands face another coronavirus surge because of a hasty return to tourism, another lockdown could spell economic disaster, Wakai said. ", "He said the state has mismanaged the pandemic from the beginning. Hawaii\u2019s state epidemiologist and its director of health both left their positions in September after concerns were raised about their handling of the virus and the state\u2019s contact tracing efforts.", "Wakai also worries that reopening tourism before children are safely back in school could challenge parents who return to work in the tourism industry. ", "But others view the pre-travel testing plan as the best way to add a layer of protection while kickstarting the economy. Hawaii has had one the nation\u2019s highest unemployment rates since the start of the pandemic, which ground to a halt nearly all vacation-related activity. ", "Hawaii Lt. Gov. Josh Green, who has spearheaded the testing program, acknowledged the risks but said the plan will give the islands a much-needed chance for economic recovery. ", "\u201cIt\u2019s important that people know we welcome them as long as they\u2019ve gotten their test,\u201d Green said, adding that wearing a mask in public is still Hawaii law.", "Green, an emergency room doctor who recently recovered from COVID-19, said calls for testing at Hawaii\u2019s airports don\u2019t take into account capacity or cost. Even if the state could test all visitors, people wouldn\u2019t get their results right away, he added.", "\u201cIf we were to test everybody that came, we would have to have 8,000 tests\u201d per day, Green said, estimating the number of visitors he thinks will travel to Hawaii at the program\u2019s start. The state currently has about 4,000 tests available each day for residents and visitors. ", "As part of the plan, Hawaii is partnering with several U.S. mainland pharmacies and airlines for testing. Travelers will load their information onto a state website and mobile app that officials will use to track incoming passengers. ", "Green said travelers must get the correct type of coronavirus screening \u2014 a nucleic acid amplification test \u2014 and suggests people work with designated companies. ", "He has also proposed implementing a surveillance testing program that would screen a percentage of arriving passengers who are in high-risk groups. ", "Dr. Anthony Fauci, who spoke with Green in a livestream video call Wednesday, said no matter what, some COVID positive vacationers will get into the state. ", "\u201cThe reality is, no matter what you do, there are going to be infected people who slip through the cracks. It\u2019s inevitable,\u201d Fauci said of Hawaii. \u201cI can understand the anxiety of people on the islands saying, you know, if you just do a test 72 hours earlier and that\u2019s all you do, then that\u2019s not going to be enough.\u201d", "Fauci said that adding some kind of secondary screening would help.", "\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get everybody, but statistically, you\u2019re going to dramatically diminish the likelihood that an infected person enters,\u201d he said. ", "Travelers will also face a list of restrictions upon arrival in Hawaii \u2014 especially on Oahu which has seen the bulk of reported cases.", "Still, some county officials say the plan is not ready. They want additional layers of protection for their individual islands.", "On Tuesday, Big Island Mayor Harry Kim announced that his county would opt out of the testing program and continue to require all visitors to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival. Gov. David Ige on Monday denied a request from the island of Kauai that would have established a post-arrival testing program for visitors to that island. Both island mayors said they want another layer of testing for people arriving in Hawaii.", "\u201cA single pre-arrival testing program alone does not provide the needed level of protection for our Kauai community,\u201d said Kauai Mayor Derek Kawakami in a statement. He said the island secured 15,000 rapid tests and will develop a plan to mitigate the virus\u2019 spread. ", "The blow to tourism has taken a toll on Hawaii residents who depend on the sector to survive. Scores of businesses have closed for good. Hotels have shuttered or operate under limited capacity. Bars remain closed and restaurants struggle with take-out only or a cap on the number of guests they can serve. The October measure could bring back paychecks for many workers.

Trump should have been sent a letter disclosing that his case was sent to the JCT for review.", "Even when the JCT was sifting through Trump\u2019s tax information, it should have remained beyond the grasp of the five Democrats and five Republicans on the committee.

Those were no drama,\u201d Kies said. \u201cOnly occasionally we would get one where there was an interpretation of the law we didn\u2019t agree with.\u201d ", "While the Joint Committee rarely makes headlines, it plays a crucial role in policymaking, delivering cost estimates that can be make-or-break for proposed tax legislation.

Tom Emmer (R-MN), the current NRCC chair, a memo laying out the case for selling voters the benefits of a divided government, with the implication that they would support congressional Republicans if they viewed them as a bulwark against Biden.", "\u201cThis is the time you have to make tough decisions,\u201d Davis said, of the party allocating its resources. \u201cYou have to let voters know there is a price if you sweep Democrats into office.\u201d", "\u201cThere are a lot of people who voted Republican for years till Trump,\u201d he added. \u201cThey haven\u2019t changed their philosophies. So, they\u2019re still getable. You have to make the argument that, \u2018Look, you can displace Trump, but you still need a Republican Senate to hold Biden in check.\u2019\u201d", "Republican veterans say there is a template for trying to focus the party\u2019s attention and resources on down-ballot races while allowing the presidential candidate to drift. The GOP was able to do so successfully in 1996, with the party holding both chambers of Congress even as Bill Clinton coasted to re-election. Should Biden win this go around, Republicans can only afford to lose three Senate seats, as they\u2019re likely to gain one in Alabama.", "The circumstances are far different 24 years later for other reasons as well. All of the sources interviewed for this piece acknowledged that the strategy carried risk, mainly because it is assumed that the party\u2019s prospects writ large are tied to Trump\u2019s core supporters coming out in droves.", "And yet, signs that some in the GOP are thinking of subtle ways to cut bait are starting to appear. Several operatives pointed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s increased warnings about Democrats expanding the Supreme Court, pushing for Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia to be granted statehood, and axing the legislative filibuster\u2014all propositions whose likelihoods are predicated on Biden winning.", "\u201cHe\u2019s already moving into those talking points. And that is by design \u201d said one top GOP operative.", "There are also signs that some of Trump\u2019s biggest financial supporters of yore are now devoting more resources to holding onto the Senate than they are to re-electing the president.", "Steve Wynn, the disgraced casino mogul who ran fundraising for the Republican National Committee early in Trump\u2019s tenure, took a brief hiatus from high-dollar political giving after dozens of people relayed allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against him (Wynn denies the allegations, but resigned from his eponymous company, Wynn Resorts, in early 2018). Those allegations were ", " by the ", " just days after Wynn cut a $500,000 check to America First Action.", "After his fall from grace, Wynn\u2019s political giving mostly dropped off. But it resumed in a big way this year. In 2020 alone, he\u2019s given $4 million to the Senate Leadership Fund and $1.5 million to American Crossroads, making him the latter\u2019s single largest donor as it tries to beat back a challenge to Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC). Wynn has also donated to McConnell\u2019s campaign and PAC this year, and made six figure contributions to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and one of its joint fundraising accounts.", "He has also contributed to the Trump campaign this year, but the sums are significantly smaller\u2014under half a million dollars to Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee benefitting the RNC and the Trump campaign, and under $400,000 to the RNC. He\u2019s given nothing to pro-Trump super PACs since that donation in early 2018.", "Among the GOP\u2019s donor base in business and finance, the incentive structure is increasingly geared towards hanging onto levers of power that could check a Democratic administration\u2014even if it means cutting bait when it comes to the White House. One top Republican lobbyist, for instance, said that corporate clients have become increasingly invested in trying to retain GOP control of the Senate for fear of the tax legislation that could originate from a Nancy Pelosi-run House and find its way to Biden\u2019s desk.", "\u201cDivided government is good for most donors and most of corporate America,\u201d the lobbyist stressed.", "And a major GOP donor based in the Midwest said that donors were increasingly focused on the Senate contests\u2014at the expense of the presidential\u2014because they have come to view Trump\u2019s campaign as an irrational entity in which to invest. Mere minutes after that donor talked up the virtues of propping up Senate institutionalists, Trump tweeted that he was unilaterally ending negotiations over a COVID-related stimulus deal. The donor promptly called back.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the stock market proves my point,\u201d he said, a sense of exasperation evident in his voice. \u201cEverything was up and now it\u2019s down 300 points cuz a guy sent a tweet. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s the head of Goldman Sachs or a food bank. They\u2019re gonna say, this is crazy.\u201d", "The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. But the president has been in this predicament before. Following the release of the ", " tapes at this very same juncture during the 2016 presidential campaign, there was a growing chorus of Republicans calling for the party to consolidate ranks around congressional candidates for the inevitability of a Hillary Clinton presidency. Trump went on to win.", "This time around, Trump\u2019s base of financial support is arguably more considerable. Putting aside the more than $400 million raised by his re-election campaign through August, he also now enjoys the backing of two high-dollar super PACs, America First Action and Preserve America PAC.", "But the president also trailed Biden by nearly $60 million in cash on hand at the end of August, the most recent reporting period. His campaign has taken down ads in various states as an effort to consolidate and prioritize resources. And there is scant desire among the formal GOP party operatives to come to the aid of a candidate who has spent his time in the political spotlight mocking, degrading, and attacking them.", "\u201cWhy should the party put more effort into winning the race than the president himself?\u201d asked Rory Cooper, a longtime Republican operative and unapologetic Never Trumper. \u201cPresident Trump is by all evidence doing more harm than good to his re-election chances. Three out of four voters don't approve of his response to COVID, meaning this includes his own supporters, and yet he triples down on what they don't like. He hasn't led a credible poll since February. Republicans need to work to hold the Senate and sell a check on a Biden agenda.\u201d"]},

This proposal, and others like it, get around that by allowing long-serving justices to hold a \u201csenior\u201d status in which they officially remain on the court but have limited duties.", "Supporters of term limits believe it would decrease the intensity of the Supreme Court confirmation process, which has become a brutal political slugfest in recent years. In turn, justices would be less likely to allow partisanship to color their rulings once they\u2019re on the court, they say. A more regular schedule of appointments would also prevent what some consider antidemocratic tactics, like Republicans\u2019 refusal to consider Barack Obama\u2019s nominee in 2016, that in some views have undermined the public\u2019s trust in the nation\u2019s highest court.\u00a0", "The Supreme Court is far too important, some argue, for its membership to be determined by whichever party happens to hold the White House and Senate when a sitting justice dies, especially since increasing life expectancy means that will happen less often. This randomness means some presidents have disproportionate influence over the court\u2019s makeup, which can skew the balance of power in the country long after they\u2019ve left office. No other democracy in the world gives lifetime appointments to members of its highest court. Others fear the court is on the brink of a legitimacy crisis. If ", "is confirmed, a majority of the Supreme Court will have been appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote.", "Opponents of term limits say regular vacancies would worsen, not reduce, partisan bickering about the court. A new seat coming available every two years would mean Congress would always have an upcoming confirmation battle on the horizon. The Founding Fathers intended lifetime appointments to free Supreme Court justices of the day-to-day influence of politics, and critics say term limits would spoil that.\u00a0\u00a0", "There are also practical questions about how the limits might be implemented, since any plan would have to consider what to do with current justices, who were all named to lifetime seats. Depending on the proposal, it could be decades before a plan for term limits has any real influence on the makeup of the court.", "The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to begin hearings on Barrett\u2019s nomination in mid-October. It\u2019s unclear at this time whether a confirmation vote will be held before or after the presidential election on Nov. 3. In the short term, the odds of any bill imposing term limits passing would almost certainly depend on Democrats taking back the Senate next year.", "\u201cImplementing term limits for the Supreme Court would be a step toward repairing and normalizing a process that raises the stakes of vacancies beyond what our politics, or the human beings who serve on the Court, can comfortably bear. It would be one important way we could deescalate the stakes of American politics, and protect the system from total breakdown.\u201d \u2014 Ezra Klein, ", "\u201cIt\u2019s time to end the unseemly position that the anachronism of life tenure for Supreme Court justices has put the country in. It\u2019s a good thing that modern medicine is extending the lives of everyone, including Supreme Court justices. But the time has come to remove the incentives that make justices serve until they drop dead or are gaga.\u201d \u2014 John Fund, ", "\u201cStaggered term limits would ensure that electoral winners shaped the Supreme Court, not the Grim Reaper.\u201d \u2014 Elie Mystal, ", "\u201cOver time, more justices would have impact, preventing the idiosyncratic preferences of one or two individuals from determining U.S. jurisprudence for decades. This plan would also eliminate the incentive for presidents to pick young and relatively inexperienced judges merely because they are likely to live longer.\u201d \u2014 Editorial, ", "\u201cThis approach would end what has become a poisonous process of picking a Supreme Court justice. It would depoliticize the court and judicial selection, and thus promote the rule of law.\u201d \u2014 Steven G. Calabresi, ", "\u201cMore than any other branch of government, the courts \u2014 and the Supreme Court in particular \u2014 gain their power from the public trust. Yet today, lifetime tenure for justices, and the strange and morbid circumstances that result, threaten to undermine that trust.\u201d \u2014 David Litt, ", "\u201cTerm limits and regularly recurring vacancies might tone down the epic Supreme Court confirmation battles that have occurred roughly twice every eight years. But they might instead make knock-down, drag-outs a recurring part of the political landscape. An election preceding the end of a swing justice\u2019s 18-year term could thrust the court into election year battles more intense than we\u2019ve already seen.\u201d \u2014 Russell Wheeler, ", "\u201cThere are also transition problems. Since term limits wouldn\u2019t apply to sitting justices, for decades we would have term-limited justices serving alongside life-tenured ones. \u2026 Fixes could be put in place to prevent all this, but at some point the complications become more trouble than they\u2019re worth.\u201d \u2014 Ilya Shapiro, ", "\u201c[Term limits] undermine the primary function of the judiciary, especially the Supreme Court: preventing political majorities from trampling on others\u2019 constitutional rights. \u2026 Judges without life tenure are less likely to act independently of the political branches or of public opinion, and thus cannot serve the purpose of holding the tyranny of the majority in check.\u201d \u2014 Suzanna Sherry, ", "\u201cIf Congress can impose an 18 year term, they can also impose one that is 3 years or 6 years, and use that power to get rid of Supreme Court justices whose decisions they dislike. When the opposing party comes to power, they can make the terms still shorter, and thereby get rid of justices they dislike.\u201d \u2014 Ilya Somin, ", "\u201cWait, why is it that once the court could go 6\u20133 in favor of strict-constructionist originalist \u2018conservative\u2019 judges that we see this concern over lowering the temperature over fights for the Court?...
